IntelliPaste-for-Xcode
======================

## Overview

IntelliPaste is an Xcode plugin that makes copy-pasting methods and RGB colors easier.

## Usage

Copy one or more methods from the method file. Then use `Shift+Cmd+V` or `Edit` > `Paste Intelligently` to copy paste them with the correct format to the header file. Alternatively, the starting point can be the header file which is then copy-pasted to the method file. You can also copy RGB colors from hex or byte values and paste them directly to NSColor/UIColor using the same shortcut or menu item.

## Installation

IntelliPaste is available through [Alcatraz - The package manager for Xcode](http://alcatraz.io/).

If you rather compile it yourself, simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. To uninstall, just remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

The plug-in is developed and tested using Xcode 5.1.1 and Xcode 6.0 (beta). 

## Limitations

This plug-in is designed for Swift and Objective-C and is currently not compatible with C and C++ code.

## Known issues

* Pragma marks and methods with comments containing curly brackets could under some circumstances fail to paste. A fix for this is on my TODO-list.
